While turning the key in the lock can certainly provide access to important areas, it does not necessarily reduce the risk of losing the key.

While the loss of predators can have an impact on a species, it is not as significant a factor as habitat destruction. Habitat destruction can directly impact the species by reducing the amount of living space available, whereas the loss of predators may have a more indirect impact.
